# PHPJasperXML2
PHPJasperXML2 is a modification of [PHPJasperXML project](https://github.com/BBFMedia/PHPJasperXML) to support json-data as a datasource and mysqli.

The examples now include a JSON example [Sample JSON 1](examples/sample_json_1.php). The data is included from data.json and contains the same data as the mysqle example.

# TODO
1. Refactor code for database use: use classes for different database drivers
2. Check for consistency with latest JasperReports file structure
